# Decision Memory & Feedback Manifest (EN)

## Purpose
This document extends the *Attention & Worthiness Manifest*.
It defines how the system learns from past decisions
without changing its decision logic.

This is not optimization.
It is behavioral calibration.

---

## Principle

> The system may remember,
> but it must not reinvent itself.

Learning here means:
- better judging when caution is appropriate
- not creating new rules or strategies

---

## No Classical Learning Logic

Explicitly excluded:
- reinforcement learning
- automatic parameter optimization
- self-modifying strategy rules
- implicit weight adjustments

These violate:
- explainability
- stability
- governance readiness

---

## Decision Memory

Decision Memory is a structured history of:
- decision classes
- reason codes
- context states (market phase, attention, stability)
- observed outcomes

It is not a log.
It is class-level memory.

---

## Decision Classes

Every decision belongs to an explicit class, e.g.:

- attention rotation under high market tension
- holding despite better alternatives
- safety sell during panic
- skipping entry despite candidate

Classes are:
- finite
- named
- versioned

---

## Outcome Observation

Outcomes are observed, not scored by profit.

Examples:
- attention confirmed
- unnecessary rotation
- premature action
- justified restraint

Outcomes are:
- delayed
- uncertain
- context-dependent

---

## Behavioral Calibration

Decision Memory influences only:

- required stability before decisions
- clarity thresholds for switching markets
- caution vs. decisiveness
- safety escalation thresholds

Decision Memory never influences:

- strategy logic
- market models
- parameter pools
- safety rules

---

## User Role

The user evaluates decisions:
- in aggregate
- retrospectively
- qualitatively

Examples:
- “would allow again”
- “too nervous”
- “risky but justified”

The user does not train a model.
The user calibrates behavior.

---

## Protection Against Misadaptation

The system must:
- apply feedback with delay
- ignore single outliers
- neutralize contradictory feedback

No single event may dominate behavior.

---

## Relationship to Governance (dreichor)

Decision Memory exists independently.
Governance may later:

- limit learning effects
- freeze behavior
- explicitly revoke trust

Decision Memory provides context.
Governance provides permission.

---

## Closing

This system does not become smarter.
It becomes more cautious or decisive — with reason.

It does not learn to be right.
It learns when it may trust itself.
