# Attention & Worthiness Manifest (EN)

## Purpose
This document defines the foundation of a trading system
that allocates capital based on **attention and market worthiness**,
not on classic indicators or profit targets.

It is not a marketing document.
It is a contract between system and operator.

---

## Core Assumptions

1. Markets are emotional.
2. Attention is limited.
3. Capital follows attention.
4. No system knows the future.
5. Decisions must be explainable, even when wrong.

---

## What This System Is

- An **attention system**, not a signal generator.
- A **decision system**, not an optimizer.
- A **rotating spot-only system**, no leverage.
- A system that acts **only when justified**.

---

## What This System Is Not

- Not a backtesting oracle.
- Not a self-learning black box.
- Not a parameter playground.
- Not a promise of profit.

---

## Attention

Attention describes how strongly a market currently captures collective focus.

Attention is:
- relative (only meaningful in comparison)
- stable (not tick-driven)
- observable (derived from behavior)

Attention is **not** price, trend, or signal.

---

## Market Worthiness

Market worthiness answers one question:

> “Does this market currently deserve attention more than others?”

A market can be worthy without rising.
A market can rise without being worthy.

---

## Rotation Over Optimization

This system does not optimize positions.
It **rotates attention**.

A position is held while:
- no other market is clearly more worthy
- risk remains acceptable

A position is exited when:
- another market justifies attention **and**
- the switch outweighs its costs

---

## Switching Is a Decision

Market switches are **not reflexes**.

A switch requires:
- stable superiority of another market
- consideration of fees, lost momentum, cooldown risk
- a clear justification

---

## Hold Time & Cooldown

- Every position has a minimum hold time.
- Every sell triggers a cooldown.
- Cooldown prevents overreaction, not risk management.

---

## Safety Over Attention

Regardless of attention:
- Severe drawdowns justify immediate exit.
- Safety overrides strategy.

Safety sells are risk controls,
not market decisions.

---

## Parameter Discipline

Parameters:
- come from predefined pools
- are selected, not invented
- are part of the decision and explainable

Parameters never change silently.

---

## Clarity

Every decision must be explainable in plain language:
- no buzzwords
- no technical excuses
- no hindsight narratives

If a decision cannot be explained,
it was not acceptable.

---

## Closing

This system does not aim to be right.
It aims to be **defensible**.

When it is wrong,
it must still be clear:
- why it acted
- why it was allowed
- and what was learned
