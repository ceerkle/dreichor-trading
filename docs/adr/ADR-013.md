# ADR-013 — Toolchain Versions & Reproducibility

## Status
Accepted

## Context
For auditability and reproducible builds, the implementation toolchain
must be version-constrained.

---

## Decisions

### Runtime
- Node.js LTS 20.x

### Language
- TypeScript ^5.0

### Testing
- Vitest ^1.0

### Package Management
- npm (bundled with Node.js)

---

## Rules
- No alternative runtimes (Deno, Bun)
- No alternative package managers
- Version upgrades require a new ADR

---

## Consequences
- Builds are reproducible
- Tests are deterministic
- Toolchain drift is controlled
