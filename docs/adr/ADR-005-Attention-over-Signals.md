# ADR-005: Attention & Worthiness over Signals

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Indicator-driven systems reduce markets to numerical patterns
and ignore collective behavior and emotion.

## Decision
The system SHALL prioritize:
- market attention
- comparative worthiness
over classical indicator signals.

Indicators may exist internally,
but must not surface as decision explanations.

## Consequences
Positive:
- Human-aligned reasoning
- Reduced indicator overfitting

Negative:
- Harder to quantify performance upfront

## Notes
Explanations must remain plain-language.
