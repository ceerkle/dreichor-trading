# ADR-010 — Implementation Language & Toolchain

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system is specified in a language-agnostic manner. However, Step 1 of the
Cursor execution order requires concrete, testable type definitions and
deterministic integrity tests. This requires a fixed implementation language
and toolchain.

## Decision
The implementation language is **TypeScript**.

### Runtime
- Node.js (LTS)
- ECMAScript target: ES2022

### Tooling
- Package manager: npm
- Build tool: tsc / ts-node
- Test framework: Vitest

### Project Structure (Minimal)
```
/src
  /core        # Pure domain & decision logic (RAGE)
  /execution   # Execution planes (NOISE/MEATSPACE)
  /meta        # Orchestration & gating
/tests
  /core
  /execution
  /meta
```

### Test Rules
- Tests must be deterministic
- No network, clock, or randomness in core tests
- No mocking in core domain tests

## Consequences
- All core domain types are implemented as TypeScript value objects
- Type integrity is enforced via compile-time typing and runtime validation
- Cursor Agent may assume this toolchain without further clarification
